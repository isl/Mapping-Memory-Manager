Mapping Memory Manager (3M)
====

Mapping Memory Manager is a package for managing mapping definition files. 
It’s based on [FIMS] (https://github.com/isl/FIMS) management system for the administration of the files and also on the 
[3MEditor] (https://github.com/isl/3MEditor) for editing and viewing the files. 

##Run##
1.	Download FIMS from https://github.com/isl/FIMS
2.	Download the 3MEditor from https://github.com/isl/3MEditor

Each one of these repositories contains further instructions on how to setup and deploy.

##Database Setup##

In order to store the database, open the eXist client application and select from the top menu "File-->Store files/directories" and then select
the DMSCOLLECTION folder located inside "db". 

##Application Setup##

Folder Structure

1.	In order some functionalities of the system to execute, an example structure of the folders needed is provided inside “3M”. 
Copy “3M” folder in your desired destination and then adjust the corresponding paths in the web.xml file. In the folder “Schema”, we provide
the schema of the Mapping.

2.	Replace context.xml located at FIMS\web\META-INF with the context.xml from “3M_configuration”.

3.	Replace web.xml located at FIMS\web\WEB-INF with the web.xml from “3M_configuration”.  Afterwards, edit the new web.xml file and make the 
changes described at FIMS repository at [README.md](https://github.com/isl/FIMS/blob/master/README.md)

a.	You will find the needed .xsd files at https://github.com/isl/x3ml/tree/master/resources/X3ML%20Schema folder. Please copy the xsd files at
    3M/Schema folder. Also rename the x3ml.xsd file to Mapping.xsd.
	
b.	You will find the uploads folder at 3M/uploads

4.	Replace the images located at the FIMS\web\formatting\images folder with the images from 3M_configuration\images

5.	Replace the css file located at the FIMS\web\formatting\css folder with the page.css from 3M_configuration\css

6.	Replace the manuals located at the FIMS\web\Manuals folder with the manuals from 3M_configuration\Manuals
